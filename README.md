## Instructions

### Create your first bot

1. Message [`@BotFather`](https://telegram.me/BotFather) with the following text: `/newbot`

   If you don't know how to message by username, click the search field on your Telegram app and type `@BotFather`, where you should be able to initiate a conversation. Be careful not to send it to the wrong contact, because some users have similar usernames to `BotFather`.

    ```
